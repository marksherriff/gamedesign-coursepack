# What is a Game?

If you randomly asked a person to answer the question "what is a game?," you would probably get a wide range of answers.  Or, potentially, just blank stares.  I mean, it's a game, right?  A game is... a game.  It's something you do when you don't have to do anything else?  It's what kids play?

Now if instead you asked "name a game," well then you'd probably get a whole list of games, ranging from card games to board games to video games to sports.  We can inherently "know" what a game is when we see it, but actually putting a definition to it can be difficult without having a more critical analysis.

Some of my favorite definitions of a game include:

> “Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.” - Bernard Suits

and

> “A game is a system in which players engage in artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.” - Salen & Zimmerman, Rules of Play
