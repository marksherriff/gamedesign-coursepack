What makes a good level in a game? Whatâ€™s the purpose of the level? To challenge? To teach? To further the story?

We will look at the first level of a few different games to see how these games go about teaching the player how to play the game.

Make sure to watch the video on Devs Play: Doom!

We will then begin our discussion of prototyping and how it can help with your game design.

Finally, we will complete the activity from Tuesday.
