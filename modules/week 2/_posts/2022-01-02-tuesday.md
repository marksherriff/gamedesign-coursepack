## Lecture Notes

__Slides:__ [Action vs. Interaction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Srv31qGqHRFi8A0BEsQNVD8Fo0Ake5owlA69kqeUGFM/edit?usp=sharing)

We will dig deeper into how player procedures and actions combine with the rules and boundaries of the game world to create interactions, thus culminating in what we would consider a _game mechanic._  

Then, an activity in playing a game like a designer and redesigning games will begin!
