# Friday, June 3

## Before Class

## Lecture Notes

We will start with the Mini-Boss Battle (a.k.a. midterm exam) at the beginning of class.

The rest of the time will be given over to working on your projects.  (I need to leave around noon to get my daughter from school as they have early dismissal on the last day.)
