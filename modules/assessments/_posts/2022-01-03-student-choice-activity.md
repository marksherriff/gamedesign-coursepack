# Student Choice Activity

This is an exercise in your creativity!  There are many, many things you could do for this assessment and it's basically up to you!

For example, you could:

* Do a comparison of certain games / genres
* Write about the state of something in games
* Explore another bit of gaming technology in some way

Feel free to talk to me about your ideas!

Note - this is worth half of a Boss Battle or other document you submit, so use that as a gauge for what I am expecting.
