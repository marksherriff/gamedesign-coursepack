Games begin as ideas on the page. Create a full design doc for a new game, going through all the different aspects of the design, including storyboarding. You can also complete this quest by writing a narrative that could be turned into a story based game, or designing a detailed puzzle for a puzzle game. Other options are also possible. Submit ONE combined PDF to the appropriate quest in your Gamer Card.
