# How to Use This Coursepack

This coursepack is broken down generally into three categories:

* Reasoning about games: What is a game?  Why do people gravitate to playing games?  How can we critically analyze what a game is?
* 

We start with an overview of software process models, discussing the differences between agile and plan-driven methodologies.  We then go through the overall general phases of development.

Each unit is comprised of a video lecture along with our notes on the given topic.
