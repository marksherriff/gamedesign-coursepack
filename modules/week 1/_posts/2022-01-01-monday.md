Welcome to CS 4730! I have a lot in store for this summer, so I hope everyone’s ready for what I hope will be an interesting ride.

We’ll start with the history of video games, particularly in America. We’ll move on into what exactly constitutes a game, which leads us into the activity on Tuesday.

Other topics:

* Class organization and management
* Required reading and games
* Required YouTube videos from "Extra Credits"
* Our development platform and ideas for the game project
