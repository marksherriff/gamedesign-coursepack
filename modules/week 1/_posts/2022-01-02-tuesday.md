## Lecture Notes

__Slides:__ [What is a game?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pp_B_0ItvXdJixniMwBKl2nFs5neCJc12BKBR-o3AOs/edit?usp=sharing)

We’ll continue with what is a game is today - please read at least the first chapter of McGonigal by today if at all possible. 

Today we will make our first games!… out of random stuff I bought at the dollar store. This is an adapted activity from Creating Games by McGuire and Jenkins. After creating our games out of a random assortment of cards, dice, army men, and river stones, we will discuss how rules play into establishing the game. We will talk about previous mental models that we have for the various pieces and how that drives some of the gameplay decisions made in creating these games.

We will link this experience to creating video games. What mechanics have we seen over and over and do we have mental models as to how they work? For instance, jumping in Super Mario Bros. – we know basically what’s going on here without much else info.
