__Assignment:__ Complete the intoductory Phasor tutorial found at [https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1).  THEN, add something new to this game.  It can be anything you want, but try to make sure the game is changed in some noticable way.  We will look at these on Tuesday.

Also, try to host your games on GitHub using the Practice repository GitHub Classroom.  You can accept the assignment and thus create your repository by going here: [https://classroom.github.com/a/80ws9cLH](https://classroom.github.com/a/80ws9cLH)
