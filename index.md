# Description

_This course will introduce students to the concepts and tools used in the development of modern 2-D and 3-D real-time interactive computer video games. Topics covered in this include graphics, parallel processing, human-computer interaction, networking, artificial intelligence, and software engineering._ -UVa Course Description

Our course is an introductory course in video game design and production. We will focus on both the design and technical aspects of creating a game, from concept inception and prototyping through coding and playtesting. 

Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

* Understand the social and ethical context in which video games are developed, marketed, and played;
* Understand the technologies and platforms upon which modern interactive video games are developed;
* Understand the software engineering concepts necessary to develop video games (and other large systems) in a large development group;
* Comprehend the computational theory used in video games design, as well as, to a lesser extent, related fields (artificial intelligence, computer graphics, networks, etc.);
* Understand the theoretical topic of game theory, and how that applies to multi-player games (and, to a lesser extent, artificial intelligence).
